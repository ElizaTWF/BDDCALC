This is a simple calculator to practice building BDD tests with
<br>

<b>Before you start...</b>	
<p>This is not  a learning session on the WHY or WHEN of BDD.
This starts from the point of having decided it is an appropriate DESIGN methodology for your features.
Yes, BDD is a design methodology which incorporates feature code and checking code. It is not a test or an automation or a development “thing” although it can (and mostly does) incorporate elements of all of those. </p>
<br>
<b>BDD with cucumber.js and node</b>
<p>Build it, code it, run it</p>

<br>
<b>What do I need to know before I start?</b>
<p>* Basic JavaScript would be good to help you read the code <br>
* Your testing attention to detail<br>
* Willingness to ask for help if you get stuck<br> </p>
<br>
<b>Plan:</b>
<p>Build local dev environment -<br>
	-> Deploy calculator with addition function<br>
		-> Identify a BDD scenario for the addition function<br>
			-> Flesh out the steps for the scenario(s)<br>
				-> Verify the output from the calculator functions<br>
					-> Run the tests<br> </p>

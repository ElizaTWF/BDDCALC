<b>What do I need to know before I start?</b>
<p>* Basic JavaScript would be good to help you read the code
* Your testing attention to detail
* Willingness to ask for help if you get stuck</p>

<b>Plan:</b>
<p>Build local dev environment -
	-> Deploy calculator with addition function
		-> Identify a BDD scenario for the addition function
			-> Flesh out the steps for the scenario(s)
				-> Verify the output from the calculator functions
					-> Run the tests</p>
